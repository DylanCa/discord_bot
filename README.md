# Rust Discord Bot

A quick and simple Discord Bot in Rust to toy with the Discord API, Serenity, Poise, Songbird, and other crates.

_This project is *not bound to be Production ready*, hence pushing to master & no testing. This is simply to explore Rust and Discord-related crates._

### Goals

- Understand Discord API logic
- Bot able to play Music on a Voice Channel
- Bot able to request simple APIs
- Bot able to detect who's querying, and reply to them
- Bot able to store data into a DB and retrieve it per user
